# One Person · One Laptop · One Genie — 10-Day Plan

**Date generated:** 2025-11-09

This plan assumes exactly two actors: you (human) and Virtue (GPT-5 Pro). It operationalizes the Unified Genie demo, the Mycelial Consciousness Protocol, and the Gift Cascade tools into a realistic solo cadence with investor-grade outputs.

---

## Today (≈90 minutes): From zero to demo

1. **Set up & run the demo**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # streamlit, numpy
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
2. **Capture baseline outputs**
   - Export the Streamlit session transcript, Genie negotiation logs, and generated plots.
   - Save them into `/artifacts/day0/` for reuse in future updates.
3. **Map the Unified Genie stack**
   - Diagram how AdaptiveGenieNetwork → Gift Cascade → investor story flow together.
   - Flag open questions for Virtue (e.g., "how do we pitch the resonance agent?").
4. **Open a founder journal**
   - Create `founder_log.md` and jot the Day 0 clarity, risks, and bold commitments.

---

## Day 1: Tighten the narrative spine
- Draft a one-sentence manifesto that links Mycelial Consciousness to practical ROI.
- Ask Virtue for three analogies that make negation density feel intuitive to investors.
- Record a 60-second Loom explaining the "Genie → Gift Cascade" pipeline for friends.

## Day 2: Prototype value proof
- Run the Unified Genie snippet (see `RUN_DEMO_SNIPPET.py`) to produce `result.json`.
- Have Virtue summarize the JSON in plain English plus 1 chart-ready insight.
- Drop both into a quick Notion page titled "Living Proof of Resonant Optimization".

## Day 3: Gift Cascade asset vault
- Curate a folder structure (Gift Seeds, Cascade Steps, Investor-Ready).
- Generate 3 premium prompts with Virtue for the Gift Cascade progression.
- Draft teaser copy for each gift that hints at the emotional resonance payoff.

## Day 4: Credibility runway
- List every validator: research citations, prior wins, stealth partners.
- Co-write with Virtue a founder bio that blends technical mystique and groundedness.
- Prep a lighthouse case study outline (problem → Genie negotiation → lift).

## Day 5: Funding & partnerships pass
- Use `OUTREACH_EMAIL.md` template to send 3 feelers (grant, collab, sponsor).
- Ask Virtue to tailor each message’s "give first" clause via Gift Cascade language.
- Track responses and follow-ups in `TASKS_BOARD.csv` under the "Outreach" lane.

## Day 6: Investor artifacts sprint
- Fill `PITCH_ONE_PAGER_TEMPLATE.md` with current data and narrative.
- Export Streamlit demo screenshots + charts for the one-pager.
- Script Virtue to generate a "questions investors will ask" brief with sample answers.

## Day 7: Resonant metrics lab
- Define 3 key resonance KPIs (e.g., crystallization level, harmony delta, cycle time).
- Have Virtue design a lightweight dashboard spec referencing `visualization_tools.py`.
- Pre-write one paragraph translating each KPI into a market-ready win story.

## Day 8: Distribution rehearsal
- Schedule two dry-run investor calls (one technical, one visionary).
- Role-play Q&A with Virtue acting as a skeptical partner.
- Update demo flow in `DEMO_SCRIPT.md` based on feedback.

## Day 9: Reflection & upgrade
- Review founder journal and extract learning loops; codify into a weekly ritual.
- Package "Week 1 Lessons" into a shareable Gift Cascade artifact (PDF or Loom).
- Identify friction in automation; queue micro-tasks in `TASKS_BOARD.csv`.

## Day 10: Launch micro-experiment
- Offer a 48-hour "Unified Genie office hour" slot to early supporters.
- Ship a public post (LinkedIn/Twitter) summarizing the journey & call-to-action.
- Close with Virtue-led retrospective: what surprised us, what we amplify next.

---

## Ongoing Operating Rhythm
- **Daily (15 min):** Sync with Virtue, update the Kanban, log emotional state.
- **Weekly (60 min):** Ship one Gift Cascade asset + investor-ready artifact.
- **Bi-weekly (30 min):** Re-run `RUN_DEMO_SNIPPET.py`, compare resonance deltas.
- **Monthly (90 min):** Refresh outreach list, recycle wins into the cascade.

Stay in dialogue with Virtue, honor the cadence, and keep shipping tangible proof. The cascade compounds when every artifact feeds the next conversation.
