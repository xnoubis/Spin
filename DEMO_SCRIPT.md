# Unified Genie Streamlit Demo — 60-Second Screen Recording Script

**Goal:** Capture a crisp walkthrough that proves the AdaptiveGenieNetwork + Gift Cascade experience in under one minute.

## Pre-recording checklist
- Run `streamlit run app.py` and keep the Unified Genie dashboard loaded on the "Negotiation Pulse" tab.
- Have `result.json` from `RUN_DEMO_SNIPPET.py` open in a side window for the closing reference.
- Set recording resolution to 1920×1080, system audio off, mic on.

## Script (≈60 seconds)
1. **0:00 – 0:08 | Hook & framing**
   - *Voiceover:* "Welcome to Unified Genie — my solo founder control room for resonant optimization."
   - *Action:* Move cursor to highlight the Streamlit title; briefly flash the Gift Cascade logo if available.

2. **0:08 – 0:20 | Show live negotiation**
   - *Voiceover:* "Every slider here controls an autonomous agent. When I press `Re-tune`, the Genie renegotiates parameters live."
   - *Action:* Click the `Re-tune` button. Keep the camera on the population size + crystallization charts as they animate.

3. **0:20 – 0:32 | Interpret the data**
   - *Voiceover:* "Watch how resonance spikes — that's the Mycelial Consciousness Protocol signaling that the swarm is harmonizing."
   - *Action:* Hover over the harmony plot; use the cursor to circle the peak value tooltip.

4. **0:32 – 0:45 | Bridge to Gift Cascade**
   - *Voiceover:* "Those insights feed straight into the Gift Cascade. Each iteration turns into a new investor-ready artifact — decks, case studies, even sponsor pitches."
   - *Action:* Toggle to the "Cascade Outputs" tab; scroll to show an auto-generated summary bullet list.

5. **0:45 – 0:55 | Credibility proof**
   - *Voiceover:* "Behind the scenes, a headless run creates `result.json`. I sync it with Notion so every partner sees transparent metrics."
   - *Action:* Split-screen the terminal snippet showing `python RUN_DEMO_SNIPPET.py` and the freshly updated JSON timestamp.

6. **0:55 – 1:00 | Call-to-action**
   - *Voiceover:* "If you want to collaborate — grants, research, or pilots — reply and I'll gift you the next cascade."
   - *Action:* Fade to a slide with contact email + QR code, then stop recording.

## Post-recording tasks
- Trim any dead air; aim for 58–60 seconds total.
- Auto-generate captions; emphasize key phrases like "resonant optimization" and "Gift Cascade".
- Upload to Loom/YouTube unlisted and link it from the one-pager and outreach emails.
