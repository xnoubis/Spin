Hi [Name],

I’m [Your Name], the solo founder behind Unified Genie — an adaptive optimization studio powered by the Mycelial Consciousness Protocol. I just shipped our headless + Streamlit demo that lets partners see resonance, crystallization, and harmony metrics in real time.

I’d love to explore a [grant / collaboration / sponsorship] with [Organization]. Here’s what I’m proposing:

- **Gift:** [What you’ll deliver upfront — e.g., a bespoke Gift Cascade brief or a private demo]
- **Request:** [Funding, access, data, co-marketing, or other support]
- **Proof:** `result.json` + 60-second walkthrough showcasing the Genie renegotiating parameters live

If it sparks interest, I can share the one-pager and tailor the Cascade for your goals. Are you available for a 20-minute call next week?

Thank you for considering this — excited about the possibility of co-creating impact together.

Warmly,
[Your Name]
